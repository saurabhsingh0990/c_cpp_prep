/*
    ðŸŒŸ MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE
    - A class is derived from another derived class.
    - Forms a "chain" of inheritance.
    - Syntax: Base -> Intermediate -> Derived
    - Used when a hierarchy of features is required.
*/


/*
ðŸ“Œ REVISION NOTES:
1. Multilevel inheritance creates a chain â€” each derived class inherits features of its parent.
2. Constructors are called from base to derived.
3. Destructors are called in reverse order (derived to base).
4. Access specifier 'protected' allows derived classes to access members, but not outside classes.

ðŸ’¡ INTERVIEW TIPS:
- Be ready to explain the **constructor/destructor calling order**.
- If a base class has a **parameterized constructor**, you MUST call it explicitly from the derived class.
- Beware of the "Diamond Problem" â†’ occurs with multiple inheritance (not multilevel).
- Always keep hierarchy logical â€” don't force inheritance if "is-a" relationship is weak.
